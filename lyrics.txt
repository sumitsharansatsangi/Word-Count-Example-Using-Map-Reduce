tere sang yaara
khushrang bahara
tu raat deewani
main zard sitaara

with you, O beloved,
the spring is colorful,
you are the crazy night,
and I am the yellow star.

O karam khudaya hai
tujhe mujhse milaya hai
tujhpe marke hi to
mujhe jeena aaya hai

it’s a divine mercy,
that I have met you.
after dying on you only
have I learned to live.

[the meaning is, that I have learned to live by falling in love with you.]

O tere sang yaara…
khushrang bahara
tu raat deewani
main zard sitaara

O tere sang yaara
khushrang bahara
main tera ho jaaun
jo tu karde ishara

with you, O beloved,
the spring is colorful,
I’ll be yours,
if you just give me a sign.

kaheen kisi bhi gali mein jaaun main
teri khushboo se Takraaun main
har raat jo aata hai mujhe
wo khwaab tu…

wherever, in whichever street I go,
I meet your fragrance,
you are the dream I dream every night.

tera mera milna dastoor hai
tere hone se mujhme noor hai
main hoon soona sa ek aasmaan
mehtaab tu…

our meeting is a custom.
there is a divine light in me from your existence,
I’m a deserted sky,
and you are the moon.

O karam khudaya hai
tujhe maine jo paaya hai
tujhpe marke hi to
mujhe jeena aaya hai

O tere sang yaara
khushrang bahara
tu raat deewani
main zard sitaara

O tere sang yaara
khushrang bahara
tere bin ab to
na jeena gawaara

With you, O beloved,
the spring is colorful,
without you now,
I wouldn’t want to live.

maine chhoDe hain baaki saare raste
bas aaya hoon tere paas re
meri aankhon mein tera naam hai
pehchaan le…

I have left all other paths,
I have come to just you.
there is your name in my eyes,
recognize it.

sab kuch mere liye tere baad hai
sau baaton ki ik baat hai
main na jaunga kabhi tujhe chhoD ke
ye jaan le

for me everything is after you,
long story short, that’s the one thing.
I’ll never go, leaving you alone,
know this.

O karam khudaya hai
tera pyar jo paaya hai
tujhpe marke hi toh
mujhe jeena aaya hai

O tere sang yaara
khushrang bahara
tu raat deewani
main zard sitaara

O tere sang yaara
khushrang bahara
main behta musafir
tu Thehra kinara

with you, O beloved,
the spring is colorful,
I am the flowing passenger,
and you are a silent shore.
